# wordpress-portainer-nginx
A stack for wordpress with MariaDB running behind nginx reverse proxy.

I was trying to get wordpress run behind nginx reverse proxy and have nginx' default network and here is the code!
-You must first have another stack with nginx reverse proxy (NPM) and then create new stacks in portainer with the above .yml
-Edit the DB info according to your needs.
-Check for latest MariaDB version that is stable for usage with WordPress and it's plugins. I will try to keep it updated here after testing it first.
